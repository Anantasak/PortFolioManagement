# PortFolioManagement
For Analyze Port Folio with LSTM Signal and using Makov for finding maximize SR

Please refer for youtube demo at https://youtu.be/MabYwN1x3oo

We using LSTM to manipulate signal data from processing asset data for signal buy/sell on option asset (short/long)

From recent video above we testing on test data 1 years (2020) can acheive as:

 Starpe_ratio = 3.9891                    
 NAV(100k) = 1.4121                     
 Score_weight = 2.4429                     
 ------------------------------                     
 Num_of_trade = 29                    
 Win = 15 (100.00%)                     
 Loss = 0 (0.00%)                     
 %Profit_per_trade = 7.57%                     
 %Loss_per_trade = N/A


Anyway on Test data 2 years (2020-2021) we can achievement at score below

 Starpe_ratio = 7.7508                     
 NAV(100k) = 1.7749                     
 Score_weight = 4.1653                     
 ------------------------------                     
 Num_of_trade = 29                    
 Win = 22 (75.86%)                     
 Loss = 7 (24.14%)                     
 %Profit_per_trade = 16.21%                     
 %Loss_per_trade = -4.06%
